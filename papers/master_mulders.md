Testar model based testing tool. Test application at GUI level. 

This thesis: State model generation in TESTAR 
abstraction level, using different combinations of Automation API's available attributes [71]
[71]

difficult to create deterministic state models. 

# chapter 1 Introduction

1.1 Graphical user interfaces.
[3] going into CI development

benefits for having a state model: 
- could be verified by expert
- comparing models between versions of the SUT
- can be used to generate better action selection

# main research questions
state modelling (literature study) and practices used in other academic tools
history in the field, history of testar

## Chapter 2

1 CR tools
2 Model based gui testing
3 automated model inference

application current state -> GUI at rest.
