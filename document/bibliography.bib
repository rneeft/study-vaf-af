We propose complementing scripted testing with scriptless test automation using the open-source testar tool. This paper gives a comprehensive overview of testar and its latest extensions together with the ongoing and future research. With this paper, we hope we can help and encourage other researchers to use testar for their GUI testing-related research and pave the way for an international research agenda in GUI testing built upon stable and open-source infrastructure.},

Automated testing is used to ensure the quality but testing through the software{\textquoteright}s GUI is challenging and therefore a research topic that has grown during the last decade. However, despite of the evolution of automated GUI-based testing methods and tools, its industrial adoption has been limited. In this paper, we present a synthesis of the evolution of GUI-based test automation and propose a classification for methods and tools for automated regression through the GUI.",
