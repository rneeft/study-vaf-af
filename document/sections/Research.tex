How can model diff help testers finding bugs
- what is a model

How can difference detection with Inferred state models on different versions of a SUT help testers finding bugs.

- What are state models in TESTAR?
- How are changes in state models detected?

- How can developers of GUI help in creating better models generated by TESTAR?
- Is it bad to add testing hooks into an application? My hypothesis is that adding hooks into code is not bad and can be consided a good practic when creating unit or even integration tests. Is my hypothesis correct and is it a correct hypothesis for GUI testing? I know that Microsoft provide attached properties for XAML based application (AutomationIds). Those properties are then used in code based GUI testing.


- How can TESTAR be changed to enable testing .NET core applications?
TESTAR generates an connection exception when trying to connect to the application created in .NET core (5). .NET core application are able to run on mac os. 

- What other tools are available that uses state model difference to reason about a change?
