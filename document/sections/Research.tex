How can model diff help testers finding bugs
s
- what is a model?

- What are state models in TESTAR?

- How are changes in state models detected?

- How can developers of GUI help in creating better models generated by TESTAR?

- Is it bad to add testing hooks into an application? I hypothesise that adding hooks into code is not bad and can be considered a good practice when creating unit or even integration tests. Is my hypothesis correct and is it a correct hypothesis for GUI testing? I know that Microsoft provides attached properties for XAML based application (AutomationIds). Those properties are then used in code-based GUI testing.


- How can TESTAR be changed to enable testing .NET core applications?

TESTAR generates a connection exception when trying to connect to the application created in .NET core (5). .NET core application can run on mac os. 

- What other tools are available that uses state model difference to reason about a change?
