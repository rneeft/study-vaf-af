\section{Planning} \label{planning}
This section will outline the planning for the GA-SE.

We don't have a crystal ball so planning a graduation project with every detail included is near to impossible. In order make sure the project is heading into the right direction the graduation project will adopt an Agile iterative approach that resembles the SCRUM methodology. Adopting the SCRUM methodology as a whole is, for a one-man-team, overkill. However some part of the SCRUM methodology will adapted. 

Although an iterative approach makes is possible to incorporate lessons learning into new decisions ans tasks, a plan(ning) is still necessary. As Eisenhower once said \textit{"Plans are worthless, but planning is everything" } \cite{eisenhower-quote},   it makes clear that even with Agile it is still important to have a plan. The graduation project consists of roughly 28 weeks (15 EC * 28 hours / 15 hours a week). One iteration (also known as a sprint in SCRUM) takes two weeks, therefore in this project 14 sprints are available. 

To make sure the projects goals are being met, a weekly meeting will be used as a control mechanism.

As a control mechanism the stakeholders, the supervisors and the student, will conduct a weekly meeting. At every start of a new sprint will start the work for the sprint is planned. The sprint end will a demo of the results of that sprint and a retrospective, what went good what can be done better. Taking in consideration the only 1 person will execute the project, the demo and planning session are hold in one meeting, taking roughly 45 minutes to an hour. During the sprint the committee will have a short meeting to assess the mid sprint process and discuss any impediments. This meeting will take roughly 15 minutes. 


The graduation project will follow the scrum methodology. Doing scrum will give the oppuritity to change the planning will executing the project. Therefore the project will be devided in a number of sprint.

The graduation project consist of 15 EC. This represents ($15*28/15$) 28 weeks.
