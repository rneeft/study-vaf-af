\section{Background} \label{background}
This section describes the background of this proposal and contains information that is available but might not be known by students and readers. 

\subsection{Introduction into GUI Testing}
Ever since the first line of software is written, testers are testing its workings. While in the early day of software, the \acrfull{ui} was mainly terminals based or a set of blinking LEDs \cite{altair8800} \footnote{For example the ALTAIR 8800 computer \cite{altair8800}}, today we have an ever-increasing amount of \acrfull{gui} applications. Testings a GUI application is labour intensive and costs a lot of money \cite{gui-history}.

Initially, testers were using \acrfull{cr} software to automate their work. A tester would record a test scenario into the CR software, and then the CR software will execute the test case when needed. Using CR software, the time required to retest software decreases; however, the big downside is that when software changes, so must the recorded scripts \cite{gui-history}.

Then came \acrfull{mbgt}. With MBGT, the GUI elements and behaviour are abstracted on a higher level. The created models are used to generate abstract test cases. Those abstract test cases need to be mapped or transformed to get concrete test cases that are executed on the SUT. The downside of MBGT is the effort required to create the models and the need to have formal modelling expertise. Formal modelling expertise is not needed with the latest evolution in test automation: model inference. 

The \emph{model inference}, also known as model extraction and GUI Ripping \cite{gui-ripping}, is the current state-of-the-art approach to automate GUI testing \cite{gui-history}. Inferred models are state graphs based on the GUI of the SUT. There are two ways to generate inferred models; the first is a static approach where the source code of the  SUT is used to create a GUI model. The second is a dynamic approach where the GUI state is captured and extracted while being executed. 

The static approach has several downsides. First, the source code must be available, which is not always the case and secondly, it is challenging to capture behaviour based on the GUI source code. For example, with HTML, it is easy to generate a model; however, its behaviour is either in Javascript or server code.  It is possible to overcome those stumbling blocks by executing the SUT.
    
As for the Dynamic approach, it captures the model during test execution. The automated test tool interacts with the SUT in a scriptless and random way. This random scriptless approach is called \emph{Monkey testing}. Usually, test monkeys have no idea in which state the SUT is in and what type of input is allowed. It is therefore essential to make the test monkey smarter. A "smart test monkey" can be achieved by making them "see" the UI elements (Section \ref{data-retrieval}). Section \ref{testar-testauto} will give more details about how TESTAR is using smart test monkeys.

\subsection{What is TESTAR?} \label{what-is-testar}
TESTAR - or TEST* - is an automated software testing tool for the GUI level \cite{testar-about}. TESTAR started within the context of the \acrfull{fittest} project. TESTAR is open-source, the source code is published on GitHub \footnote{ \url{https://github.com/TESTARtool/TESTAR\_dev}}. A screenshot of the TESTAR tool is displayed in Figure \ref{fig:testar}.

\endgroup

TESTAR has several \emph{execution modes} in which it interacts with the SUT \cite{testar-manual}. From left to right, in figure \ref{fig:testar}, those are Spy, Generate, Record, Replay and View mode.

The \emph{Spy} mode allows the user to inspect a SUT and analyse how TESTAR is interpreting the widgets on the screen. Figure \ref{fig:calc-spy} shows the Windows calculator in spy mode. Dots on the GUI indicate actions that TESTAR could execute to interact with the SUT. Furthermore, within TESTAR, it is possible to filter out actions. Then, TESTAR will not execute those actions. The filtered actions are marked with a grey-coloured dot. A list with properties about the widget is shown when hovering, as well as a unique identifier of the current \emph{state}, more information about the state and the unique identifier can be found at section \ref{gui-state}.\par

\endgroup

In the \emph{Generate} mode, TESTAR will start testing the specified system. Section \ref{testar-testauto} gives more details about TESTAR test automation.

The \emph{Record} mode allows a tester to record a test sequence manually. In the \emph{Replay} mode, existing test execution can be re-executed and lastly, the \emph{View} mode allows existing test executions to be viewed.

\subsubsection{TEST automation} \label{testar-testauto}
TESTAR works without test scripts. Instead, it uses GUI Ripping and Monkey testing techniques. \emph{GUI Ripping}, first introduced by Memon et al. \cite{gui-ripping}, is a process to obtain the GUI's structure and execution behaviour automatically. As for \emph{Monkey testing}, it is a process in which decisions (interactions with the GUI) are randomly made. Section \ref{data-retrieval} will give more insights into GUI Ripping.
TESTAR is using a flow to execute tests on the SUT. This flow is as follows:
\begin{samepage}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Start the SUT
    \item Scan the GUI and obtain the state (Section \ref{gui-state})
    \item Finding and selecting an action to execute
    \item Evaluate state with a test oracle (Section \ref{test-oracles})
    \item Stop the SUT when no actions are left to be executed or restart the SUT when more sequences are required.
\end{enumerate}
\end{samepage}

\endgroup

Figure \ref{fig:testar-test-cycle} shows the flow graphically \cite{VosAho2021}. The test specialist needs to provide SUT details to TESTAR, like which actions should not be executed, and devise a mechanism that defines which SUT behaviour is correct and which is not, named a test oracle (Section \ref{test-oracles}). 

\subsection{How is the SUT tested} \label{test-oracles}
When software is tested, a method is needed to check the correct behaviour of the SUT. The method of checking is formally known as a \emph{test oracle} \cite{testOracles}. An example of a test oracle, widely used by developers, is a code \emph{assertion} that is a Boolean assertion. Developers can create assertions in software to check its behaviour during run-time \cite{barr2014oracle}. Assertions can also be used in unit tests as displayed below on Listing \ref{code:assert}. 

%% do not indent code since it indents its extra in the LaTeX output
\begin{lstlisting}[language=Java, caption=Example assertion, label=code:assert]
@Test
public void testAdd(){
    Calculator sut = new Calculator();

    int expected = 3;
    int actual = sut.Add(1,2);

    Assert.assertEquals(expected, actual);
}
\end{lstlisting}

\subsubsection{Online and Offline Test oracles}
Test oracles come in two variants, \emph{online} or \emph{on-the-fly} test oracles and \emph{offline} test oracles \cite{VosAho2021}. With online test oracles, the state under test is being asserted for any anomalies during test execution. For example,  an online test oracle inspects the URL to check for any information being exposed in the query string. Offline test oracles will look into stored data - like logs - to find anomalies after test execution. For example, offline test oracles can inspect all the visited URLs to check for any exposed information in the query strings.

The two test oracle variants are complementary to each other and can run side by side. However, each variant comes with its strengths and weaknesses. The online test oracle takes up computation time because it inspects the state during test execution. This inspection of state slows down the test execution and may become an issue with time-critical SUTs. On the other hand, some issues - like the SUT becoming unresponsive - can only be checked during test execution. An offline test oracle is inspecting the gathered data after test execution has finished. Especially with larger data sets, this can become helpful. Inspecting the data may run in parallel, which can speed up the test oracle. Additionally, when developers create new offline test oracles, they can inspect the recorded data instead of executing a new test run \cite{de2019offline}.

\subsection{How is data retrieved} \label{data-retrieval}

Section \ref{testar-testauto} discussed how TESTAR is using GUI ripping to obtain the GUI's structure. A GUI consists of a non-empty set of UI components, known as \emph{widgets}. Examples of widgets are Windows or buttons; more examples can be found in Table \ref{tables:widgets} \cite{VosAho2021}. 

\begingroup
\captionsetup{type=table}
\begin{tabularx}{\textwidth}{ 
  | >{\raggedright\arraybackslash}X 
  | >{\raggedright\arraybackslash}X 
  | >{\raggedright\arraybackslash}X | }
    \hline
    Windows & Menus & Controls \\
    \hline
    \hline
    main windows & menu bars & buttons \\
    child windows & dropdown menus & textboxes \\
    popup windows & context-aware menus & links \\
    && radio buttons \\
    && checkboxes\\
    && dropdown select boxes\\
    && sliders\\
    && tabs\\
    && scrollbars \\
    \hline
\end{tabularx}
\captionof{table}{Example of GUI widgets \cite{VosAho2021}}\label{tables:widgets}
\endgroup

The widgets are structured hierarchically in a \emph{widget tree}. Each node in the tree is a widget with its related properties, such as the title, position and role. In figure \ref{fig:widget-tree} a compact widget tree is shown for the calculator.

\subsection{Widget data API}

In order to retrieve data from a SUT, TESTAR is making use of external APIs to access widgets that are part of the GUI \cite{thesisMulders}. TESTAR is using three different APIs.

In order to test a desktop application, TESTAR makes use of the Windows Automation API. The purpose of the Windows Automation API is to expose rich information about UI elements\cite{win-api-info}. For web applications, TESTAR uses Selenium Chromedriver. The Chromedriver is a tool for automated testing. It provides capabilities for navigating through web pages, user input, and JavaScript execution \cite{chrome-driver-info}. The latest API that TESTAR is using is Appium. Appium is a test automation tool for native, mobile web, and hybrid applications on iOS mobile, Android mobile, and Windows platforms \cite{appium-info}.

\subsection{GUI State} \label{gui-state}
In the previous sections, the widget tree is discussed and how the widgets are retrieved. In the widget tree, all the GUI elements with their properties are captured. The widget tree represents the state of the GUI when it has stopped executing any action. The GUI is at 'rest'. When an action is executed, the GUI can change, going to a new state. In figure \ref{fig:state-actions} the state change is represented in a small graph. 
\bigskip
\begingroup
\captionsetup{type=figure}
\includegraphics{pics/state-action.png}
\captionof{figure}{An graph with two states and two actions.}\label{fig:state-actions}
\endgroup

The graph is a directed graph since every action changes the GUI from one state to the other. An action may lead to the same state, see figure \ref{fig:state-actions} action \textit{y}. However, that would mean that the action does not do anything or TESTAR does not indicate a change. For example, the GUI changes but not the property corresponding to the change is not included in the widget tree.

The universe of states and actions of the SUT's GUI makes up an inferred model. More information about the inferred model and how they are created can be found in section \ref{inferred-model}.

\subsection{How is data persisted}

TESTAR is using a database to store and retrieve state model data. Gier and Kager investigated which data storing solution would be beneficial to TESTAR \cite{GierKager}. The data solution must comply with six requirements. Generally speaking, the requirements were as follows: an open-source graph database with a straightforward query mechanism. The conclusion was that OrientDB was the best solution that met all the requirements.

\begin{samepage}
OrientDB is a Multi-Model NoSQL \acrfull{dbms} that combines four models \cite{orientDbModeling}:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \hyperlink{db:key-value}{Key/Value}
    \item \hyperlink{db:document}{Document}
    \item \hyperlink{db:graph}{Graph}
    \item \hyperlink{db:object}{Object}
\end{itemize}
\end{samepage}

A \hypertarget{db:key-value}{\emph{Key/Value}} is the simplest model and allows storing information (value) that is accessible with a key. Key/Values can be grouped into \textit{buckets}. However, OrientDB supports richer models in the form of document and graph elements.

A \hypertarget{db:document}{\emph{document}} is a schema-less set of key/value pairs. The \emph{key} allows access to the corresponding value. OrientDB allows the developer to store documents into \emph{clusters}. Relations between document are either embedded into other document or \emph{linked} to each other. Someone familiar with relational databases can view a cluster as tables, a document as the row and the key/value pairs are columns.

The \hypertarget{db:graph}{\emph{graph}} is a model consisting of \emph{Vertices} and \emph{Edges}. Vertices are the nodes in the graph, and the edge is the link between those nodes. In TESTAR terminology, a vertex represents state, and the edge is an 'action' from one state to the next. A Vertex consists of three elements: a unique identifier, a set with incoming Edges and outgoing Edges. An edge consists of four elements: a unique identifier, an incoming vertex (\emph{head}), an outgoing vertex (\emph{tail}) and a label that describes the relationship between the head and tail vertex.\par

The last model is the \hypertarget{db:object}{\emph{object}} that supports inheritance, like in the Object-Oriented programming paradigm.\par

Despite being a NoSQL database, OrientDB does support SQL as a query language \cite{sql-lang} albeit that it does not support all SQL statements. The majority of developers have experience with SQL \cite{sql-stats}, and as a result, new developers and students can start querying the TESTAR data and start expanding its features.\par

In addition to TESTAR, other applications can query the state model data in the OrientDB database as well. For example, developers and students can create external tools for a single purpose, like a state model difference application. When building external tools, the TESTAR application can be kept small and focus upon one objective: testing GUI applications.
